Octamino is the brainchild of Tom Young, math teacher now retired, who when remodeling his bathroom asked this question - "How can I create a tiling pattern for the shower?"

His novel idea was to find how many ways the `n^2` squares of a `n x n` square could be configured with n identical groups of `n` tiles where the `n` tiles did not have to be connected

After drawing the possibilities for a 2 x 2 square, then a 3 x 3 square, and exasperatingly trying to draw the possibilities for the 4 x 4, he wrote a program to find the answer

There are 60 configurations for the 4 x 4 square, only 1 way to tile the 5 x 5 square, 102 ways for the 6 x 6, only 1 way for the 7 x 7, and 62714 ways for the 8 x 8

These are pictured at the [Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) entry A363381](https://oeis.org/A363381)

Along with his daughter, Kelsey, Tom developed this puzzle using the 62714 solutions of the 8 x 8 square

There are outstanding mathematical questions. For instance, is 1 the number of solutions for a `n x n` square when `n` is prime? Is there an explicit formula to predict the number of solutions? What are the answers for `n > 8`? What are the 3D analogues?
